# TMDb Data Warehouse
This is my rapid solution to submit my assestment in SOA class, this is a data warehouse using TMDb API, Python and MySQL
Please don't think this is a good data warehouse for TMDb. Still need to rewrite the code for the best TMDb data warehouse.

Requirement:
- read TMDb API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
- Python
  - tmdbv3api  $ pip install tmdbv3api
  - MySQL-connector
  - json
  - urllib
- MySQL
- A cup of hot coffee
